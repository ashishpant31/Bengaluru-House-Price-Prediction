# Bengaluru-House-Price-Prediction

This project focuses on predicting house prices in Bengaluru, India, leveraging machine learning techniques. The goal is to build a model that can accurately estimate the price of a house based on various features such as location, size, amenities, and other relevant factors.

Data Collection and Preprocessing
1. Data Source: We obtained our dataset from Kaggle and other trusted sources, comprising real estate listings in Bengaluru with details like area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, amenities, and price.
2. Data Cleaning: We cleaned the dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies in the data.
3. Feature Engineering: We engineered new features such as total area (combining carpet area, built-up area, and super built-up area) and extracted information like locality and amenities.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
1. Statistical Analysis: We performed statistical analysis to understand the distribution of house prices and identify outliers.
2. Visualization: Using libraries like matplotlib and seaborn, we created visualizations (scatter plots, box plots, etc.) to explore relationships between features and the target variable (house price).

Model Building
1. Feature Selection: Based on EDA, we selected relevant features for training our model such as area, number of bedrooms, locality, and amenities.
2. Model Selection: We experimented with regression algorithms like Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, and Random Forest Regression to find the best-performing model for predicting house prices.
3. Model Training and Evaluation: We split our dataset into training and testing sets, trained our models on the training data, and evaluated them using metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R-squared.

Deployment and Documentation
1. Jupyter Notebook: Documented the entire project workflow in a Jupyter Notebook, detailing data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.
2. GitHub Repository: Hosted the project on GitHub, providing code and documentation for transparency and reproducibility.

Future Work
1. Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize model performance by tuning hyperparameters using techniques like grid search or random search.
2. Incorporating External Data: Enhance the model by incorporating external datasets such as neighborhood demographics or market trends.
3. Interactive Web Application: Develop an interactive web application where users can input house features and get instant price predictions.

By applying machine learning to real estate data, this project demonstrates a practical use case of predictive analytics that can assist homebuyers, sellers, and real estate professionals in making informed decisions about property transactions in Bengaluru.
